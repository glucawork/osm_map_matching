# Summary

In the map-matching problem, a sequence of geographic positions, typically obtained from GPS data, must be aligned with the routes depicted in a digital map. The aim is to accurately determine the most likely route taken by a moving object, such as a vehicle or pedestrian, by matching the observed data points with the roads or pathways described by the map.

`osm-map-matching` is a Python-based QGIS plugin [@QGIS] designed to match an input vector layer of observed geographic positions with corresponding routes from OpenStreetMap (OSM) [@OSM]. The output is a vector layer containing linestrings that represent the matched routes. Each linestring in the vector corresponds to a continuous segment characterized by consistent features extracted from the map data.

The solution used employs a topology-based algorithm that calculates the shortest path from points in the road network that have specific proximity characteristics to the input points. This resulting algorithm is significantly faster than others [@Duffield2022, @Jung2019] without sacrificing the quality of the solutions.

# Statement of need

As far as we know there exist two map matching plugin for QGIS, *Offline-MapMatching* [@Jung2019] and, *Assisted-MapMatching* [@Gelb]. 

The two plugins are based on Hidden Markov Models, known for their high time complexity [@newson2009hidden], resulting in long execution times. Our plugin's algorithm computes, for each input point $p$, the shortest-path tree of a small region centered around $p$, significantly improving its practical speed.

Additionally, we were unable to fully get the two plugins to work, possibly due to lack of maintenance as they have not been updated in the past two years.

# Functionality

Once the plugin is launched, a vector layer of points, `points_vector`, describing the route to be mapped should be provided along with two numerical parameters: `max_dist` and `min_loop_size`. The `max_dist` parameter specifies the maximum allowable distance between a point in the vector layer and its corresponding element on the map. The `min_loop_size` parameter is applied during the final route cleaning phase to remove small loops from the route that are shorter than this parameter's value.

The plugin generates a route on OSM based on the input vector layer. The output is a vector layer consisting of consecutive linestrings. Each linestring represents a segment of the route as a sequence of points, with additional fields detailing the segment's attributes, which are derived from OSM data. The table below provides an excerpt from the *attribute table* of a linesting vector layer generated by the plugin. Each row represents a linestring description, with the columns detailing the attributes. Besides the ID assigned by OSM, the only attribute consistently present is `highway`, which indicates the type of street, road or path in OSM.

\autoref{fig:routerepr}  illustrates a graphical representation of the `highway` field. Dashed lines are used for values such as `path`, `footway`, and `steps`, whereas a solid line represents all other values.

Moreover, starting from the plugin output, it is possible to create a clear and concise presentation of the data through straightforward operations in the QGIS environment

# Algorithm description

OpenStreetMap data consists of *nodes*, *ways*, and *tags*. Nodes are points with geographic coordinates. Ways are sequences of nodes that describe linear features like roads or paths. Tags are key-value pairs that describe attributes, such as `highway=residential` for a residential road.

After selecting the input vector layer (`points_vector`) and specifying the two numerical parameters (`max_dist` and `min_loop_size`), the algorithm retrieves the OSM map section that includes the `points_vector`. It then constructs the road graph $G$ using the NetworkX library  [@networkx], labeling the edges of $G$ with tags extracted from OSM ways."

At each iteration, the algorithm attempts to match each point in `points_vector` with a node in $G$. Let $p$ be the last matched point and $v_p$ the corresponding node in $G$, and let $q$ be the next point to be matched. The algorithm computes the shortest path tree $T_p$ in $G$, rooted at $v_p$. It then searches for the edge $e_q$ in $T_p$ that is closest to $q$ and matches $q$ to the node of $e_q$ that is nearest to $q$.
