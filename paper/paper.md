# Summary

In the map-matching problem, a sequence of geographic positions, typically obtained from GPS data, must be aligned with the routes depicted in a digital map. The aim is to accurately determine the most likely route taken by a moving object, such as a vehicle or pedestrian, by matching the observed data points with the roads or pathways described by the map.

`osm-map-matching` is a Python-based QGIS plugin [@QGIS] designed to match an input vector layer of observed geographic positions with corresponding routes from OpenStreetMap [@OSM]. The output is a vector layer containing linestrings that represent the matched routes. Each linestring in the vector corresponds to a continuous segment characterized by consistent features extracted from the map data.

The solution used employs a topology-based algorithm that calculates the shortest path from points in the road network that have specific proximity characteristics to the input points. This resulting algorithm is significantly faster than others [@Duffield2022, @Jung2019] without sacrificing the quality of the solutions.

# Statement of need

As far as we know there exist two map matching plugin for QGIS, *Offline-MapMatching* [@Jung2019] and, *Assisted-MapMatching* [@Gelb]. 

The two plugins are based on Hidden Markov Models, known for their high time complexity [@newson2009hidden], resulting in long execution times. Our plugin's algorithm computes, for each input point $p$, the shortest-path tree of a small region centered around $p$, significantly improving its practical speed.

Additionally, we were unable to fully get the two plugins to work, possibly due to lack of maintenance as they have not been updated in the past two years.

# Functionality

Once the plugin is launched, a vector of points, `points_vector`, describing the route to be mapped should be provided along with two numerical parameters: `max_dist` and `min_loop_size`. The `max_dist` parameter specifies the maximum allowable distance between a point in the vector and its corresponding element on the map. The `min_loop_size` parameter is applied during the final route cleaning phase to remove small loops from the route that are shorter than this parameter's value.

The plugin generates a route on OSM that corresponds to the input vector of points. The output data structure is a vector of consecutive `LineStrings`. Each `LineString`, in addition to the sequence of points, includes several fields that describe the attributes of the segment, which are derived from OSM data. The table below provides an excerpt from the *attribute table* of a `LineString` vector generated by the plugin. Each row represents a `LineString` description, with the columns detailing the attributes. Besides the ID assigned by OSM, the only attribute consistently present is `highway`, which indicates the type of street, road or path in OSM.

Figure  \autoref{fig:routerepr}  illustrates a graphical representation of the `highway` field. Dashed lines are used for values such as `path`, `footway`, and `steps`, whereas a solid line represents all other values.

Moreover, starting from the plugin output, it is possible to create a clear and concise presentation of the data through straightforward operations in the QGIS environment

|------------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| `primary`    | 67  | 74  | 141 | 70.5         |
| `residential`| 24  | 290 | 816 | 116.57       |
| `footway`    | 2   | 22  | 47  | 11.75        |
| `track`      | 99  | 298 | 397 | 198.5        |
| `path`       | 13  | 381 | 585 | 117          |
| `service`    | 10  | 78  | 88  | 44           |
